# üëã About Me

Hey, I‚Äôm a junior frontend developer! üëã  
I recently finished a bootcamp where I learned **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, Express, React, and Agile methodologies**, along with the basics of working in a terminal. Now, I‚Äôm focused on **solving DSA problems** and **building projects from scratch** to improve my understanding of real-world development.

My current project is a **movie web app using the IMDB API**, where I‚Äôm diving into **TypeScript and React**, learning how to properly structure a project, organize work with commits, and integrate testing from the start.

I enjoy tackling **technical challenges** and developing my ability to **think abstractly and solve problems**. I thrive in **fast-paced environments** and love working with **high-performance teams** where collaboration and clear communication are essential.

Outside of coding, I‚Äôm into **Sim Racing, Weightlifting, and Coffee** ‚Äì always chasing better lap times, stronger lifts, and the perfect brew. ‚òïüèéÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
